# Data

This repository does not include the real dataset due to privacy and ethical reasons.  

To reproduce the experiments:  
1. Obtain the dataset file `hcc_dataset.csv` (Hepatocellular Carcinoma Dataset).  
2. Place it in this `data/` folder.  
3. Make sure the notebook paths point to `data/hcc_dataset.csv`.  

⚠️ Note: The `.gitignore` is configured to exclude all files inside `data/`, so the dataset will never be uploaded to the repository.
